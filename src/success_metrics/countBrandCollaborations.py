# This module would contain logic to count the number of brand collaborations.

# Placeholder for brand collaboration counting logic

def count_brand_collaborations():
    # Assume the data source is a simple list of brand collaborations. In practice, this might be replaced with a 
    # database query, API call, etc., depending on the actual data source.
    brand_collaborations = ['Brand A', 'Brand B', 'Brand C']  # Replace with actual data retrieval logic
    collaboration_count = len(brand_collaborations)
    return collaboration_count

# Example usage:
# collaboration_count = count_brand_collaborations()
