# This module would contain logic to count the number of active users.

# Placeholder for active user counting logic

def count_active_users():
    # Implement logic to count and report the number of active users
    # Example implementation (to be replaced with real logic):
    # Query the database to get the list of active users
    # Connect to the MongoDB database
    from pymongo import MongoClient
    client = MongoClient('mongo_connection_string')  # replace with proper MongoDB connection string
    db = client['mydatabase']  # replace with your database name
    active_users_collection = db.active_users  # replace with your collection name

    # Query the database to count the number of active users
    active_user_count = active_users_collection.count_documents({'status': 'active'})
    return active_user_count

# Example usage:
# active_user_count = count_active_users()
