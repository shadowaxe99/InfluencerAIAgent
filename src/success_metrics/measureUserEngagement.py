# This module would contain logic to measure user engagement metrics.

# Placeholder for user engagement measurement logic

def measure_user_engagement():
    # Connect to the MongoDB database
    from pymongo import MongoClient
    client = MongoClient('mongo_connection_string')  # replace with proper MongoDB connection string
    db = client['mydatabase']  # replace with your database name
    interactions_collection = db.interactions  # replace with your collection name

    # Query the database to get user interactions
    interaction_documents = interactions_collection.find({})

    # Assuming a function `calculate_engagement_metrics` exists that calculates the metrics based on the documents
    engagement_metrics = calculate_engagement_metrics(interaction_documents)
    return engagement_metrics

# Example usage:
# engagement_metrics = measure_user_engagement()
